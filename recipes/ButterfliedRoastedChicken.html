        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Want to cook whole chicken quicker and more evenly? 
            Remove the backbone with a knife or kitchen scissors 
            to flatten the chicken. The breast meat doesn't dry 
            out, the dark meat is tender and juicy, and there's 
            lots of crispy golden skin to enjoy. Here, it's simply
            roasted with lemon and rosemary, but butterflied chicken
            is especially good on the grill.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><em>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1(3 pound) whole chicken, backbone removed</li>
            <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 lemon, sliced into rounds</li>
            <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        </em></ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Line a rimmed baking pan with aluminum foil. Place 
                a rack on top of foil.</li>

            <li>Rub olive oil on both sides of chicken and generously
                season with salt and black pepper. Arrange lemon 
                slices and rosemary on the rack and place chicken, 
                skin-side up, onto the rack.</li>
            
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until no longer pink at
                the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 55 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest 
                part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F 
                (74 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Transfer chicken to a serving platter and tent a piece of
                aluminum foil over it. Discard lemon and rosemary and remove 
                rack.</li>
            
            <li>Pour wine into the baking pan and gently loosen the bits of 
                food in the pan with a wooden spoon, being careful not to tear 
                the foil. Strain pan juices into a saucepan and bring to a boil; 
                cook until sauce is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Spoon sauce 
                over chicken.</li>
        </ol>
